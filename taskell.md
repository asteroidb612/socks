## To Do

- Add sock pair counting for Chris, Drew
- Track individual socks?
- Send bug reports to lamdera folks

## Done

- Count total socks

## But Reports
- If you check in a migration but not the source, `lamdera check` is happy but `lamdera deploy` says delete migration
- (e877437) If you have a non-existent type in Types (say "Key") then codegen fails, not compile 
- (3d99471) (maybe elm?) view = case statement doesn't go well. Maybe in model ends up as "..Empty" not "Nothing"
